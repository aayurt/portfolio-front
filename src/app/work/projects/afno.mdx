## Overview

Afno App Web is a modern restaurant discovery and management platform focused on connecting users with Nepalese restaurants. It combines a fast, SEO-friendly public web experience with a powerful multi-tenant admin system that allows each restaurant to manage its own content, menus, and operations independently.

The goal was to create a scalable foundation that supports both customers and restaurant owners while keeping the experience simple, reliable, and performant.

## Key Features

- **Restaurant Discovery**: Browse restaurants with detailed profiles, menus, categories, ratings, and promotions.
- **Menu Management**: Dynamic food categories, items, pricing, and availability controlled by each restaurant.
- **Location & Delivery Support**: Maps, address management, and delivery radius configuration.
- **Promotions & Discounts**: Time-based deals and featured campaigns to increase engagement.
- **Reviews & Feedback**: User ratings and reviews to build trust and transparency.
- **Multi-tenant Admin Dashboard**: Secure, role-based access where each restaurant manages its own data in isolation.
- **CMS-powered Content**: Flexible content editing for faster updates without developer involvement.
- **Performance & SEO**: Server-rendered pages for fast load times and better search visibility.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: Full-stack React framework with SSR and API routes  
- **Payload CMS**: Multi-tenant content and admin management  
- **PostgreSQL**: Database, auth, and backend services  
- **Docker**: Local development and deployment consistency  
- **Knex.js**: Modular relational queries  
- **Authentication (OTP + role-based access)**

## Challenges and Learnings

Designing a true multi-tenant architecture required careful data modeling and permission handling to ensure strict tenant isolation while keeping the system flexible.

Another challenge was balancing rich features (menus, promotions, reviews) with performance. Leveraging server rendering and modular queries helped maintain fast load times as the platform scaled.

Building both the customer-facing app and the admin tools also reinforced the importance of thinking like both a user and an operator.

## Outcome

Afno App Web serves as the foundation for a growing restaurant ecosystem, enabling restaurants to manage their digital presence independently while giving users an easy way to discover and explore local food options.

The platform is built to scale, allowing rapid feature expansion and onboarding of new restaurants with minimal overhead.
