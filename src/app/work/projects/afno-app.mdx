## Overview

The Afno App Mobile app brings restaurant discovery to iOS and Android with a fast, native-like experience. Built with a single cross-platform codebase, the app focuses on smooth performance, simple navigation, and real-time data synced with the web platform.

The goal was to make finding local Nepalese food effortless — whether users are browsing nearby spots, checking menus, or exploring promotions on the go.

## Key Features

- **Restaurant Discovery**: Search and browse restaurants by location, cuisine, and popularity
- **Rich Restaurant Profiles**: Menus, categories, pricing, photos, and opening hours
- **Location-aware Experience**: Nearby restaurants and delivery radius support
- **Promotions & Deals**: Highlighted offers and discounts
- **Favorites & Quick Access**: Save preferred restaurants for faster reordering
- **Realtime Updates**: Menu and availability changes synced instantly with backend
- **Shared Backend with Web**: Consistent data across mobile and web platforms

## Technologies Used

- **Flutter**: Cross-platform mobile development  
- **Dart**: Application logic  
- **Firebase**: Database, authentication, and APIs  
- **REST APIs**: Data communication  
- **Role-based authentication**: Secure user sessions  

## Challenges and Learnings

One challenge was ensuring a native-feeling experience while maintaining a shared codebase. Careful state management, optimized API calls, and lazy loading helped keep the app smooth and responsive.

Keeping mobile and web platforms in sync also required thoughtful API design and consistent backend contracts to avoid duplication or drift.

This project strengthened my approach to mobile UX, performance optimization, and cross-platform architecture.

## Outcome

Afno App Mobile provides users with a convenient, on-the-go way to discover restaurants while sharing the same scalable infrastructure as the web platform. The unified architecture enables faster development, easier maintenance, and consistent experiences across devices.
